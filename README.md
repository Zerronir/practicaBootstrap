# Boostrap design assignment
This is a design task from a web developer degree

## Install
Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install all dependencies used in this project

## Running for the first time
After runnin `npm i` to install all dependencies you must use gulp to compile sass, it is
pre-compiled already so you must do it in case you've modified something in the scss code.

After that go ahead and in a localhost server open the index.html file to see its content.

### Enjoy
